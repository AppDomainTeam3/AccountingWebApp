<h1>Instructions</h1>
<p>To get started, open a terminal and navigate to the root directory. Create a <a href="https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/">virtual environment</a>, activate it, and download the required modules with the command: 'pip install -r requirements.txt'. Navigate to /API and run app.py (backend). In a separate terminal, navigate to the root directory and run app.py (frontend). Default host is http://127.0.0.1:5000 for frontend, http://127.0.0.2:5000 for backend.</p>
<p>**Our API was originally contained within another repo. The commit history prior to 2/26/2021 can be found <a href="https://github.com/AppDomainTeam3/AccountingAPI">here</a>.</p>
